# Run-Time
* Perform an experimental analysis of the two algorithms prefixAverage1 and prefixAverage2,
* Visualize their running times as a function of the input size with a log-log chart. 
   
   - test values (double previous test value)
   - generate random array
   - test prefixAverage1 start to finish !not whole code|  O(n^2) has two for loops 
   - test prefixAverage2 start to finish|  O(n) very linear only one for loop
